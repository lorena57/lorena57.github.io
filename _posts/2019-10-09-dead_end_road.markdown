Why did I begin to start coding? Well I've been in Quality Assurane for over 15 years and with the ever changing environment with technology I knew one day I would be out of a job due to automation (I still have a job, for now).  So here I am with FlatIron trying and struggling to complete my CLI project.  This is my 2nd round with being in a cohort,  yeah I'm not happy that I have to wait longer until I complete the course but I'm gald that this time around I truly I understood the fundaments of Ruby. 

My CLI project showed me how classes have relationships with one another.  Not only did I learn about classes but I learned about methods how  they make my project work, it's pretty cool how they work in harmony that is if you wrote them properly.  Pry is a life saver, I'm still learning to use it and one day I will master it.  So until then I must get back to writing my last method.  Good day, by the way I hate writing.  I will get back to this though and rewrite it once I learn how to write in more of a technical manner.
